        <h1>About zStudio</h1>

        <h2>What is zStudio?</h2>
        <p>
            zStudio is a lightweight visual authoring tool built to make 2D web game production faster, cleaner, and far
            more efficient. Designed by a game development lead with over 15 years of industry experience, it gives
            teams a
            powerful way to build UI layouts, scene structures, templates, and multi-resolution game interfaces — all
            visually, all in one place.
        </p>
        <p>
            Originally created to solve real workflow bottlenecks inside a commercial game studio, zStudio is now used
            in
            production on multiple web-based titles, including games currently deployed to international operators.
            It is actively used by professional developers and continues to evolve through real-world feedback.
        </p>

        <h2>Why zStudio was built</h2>
        <p>
            Modern web games rely on responsive layouts, reusable UI systems, and efficient pipelines. But many studios
            still build and manage scenes manually — causing slow iteration, inconsistent layouts, and extra engineering
            overhead.
        </p>
        <p>
            zStudio was created to bridge the gap between design and implementation. It gives developers, technical
            artists, and animators a unified space to compose scenes, control layout behavior, test responsiveness, and
            export clean, structured data directly into Pixi.js or similar engines.
        </p>

        <h2>What zStudio enables</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rapid UI/Layout creation</strong> — Build scenes visually instead of coding containers by hand.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Automatic multi-resolution support</strong> — Preview and optimize layout for portrait,
                landscape,
                and custom ratios.</li>
            <li><strong>Hierarchical scene building</strong> — Create, group, nest, and organize complex structures with
                ease.</li>
            <li><strong>Template-based workflows</strong> — Build reusable components that update all instances when
                changed.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrated test mode</strong> — Preview animations, hierarchies, and layout behavior instantly.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Efficient exporting</strong> — Generate JSON scene files, texture atlases, and font definitions
                ready
                for runtime.</li>
            <li><strong>Import pipeline</strong> — Bring zStudio scenes directly into your rendering environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who it's for</h2>
        <p>
            zStudio is ideal for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web game developers building Pixi.js, Phaser, or custom 2D engines</li>
            <li>Technical artists who need precise control without writing boilerplate code</li>
            <li>UI/UX teams creating dynamic, responsive interfaces</li>
            <li>Studios looking to streamline iteration and reduce integration time</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>A production-proven tool</h2>
        <p>
            zStudio is not a prototype — it is actively used in a commercial studio and has already powered multiple
            shipped and soon-to-launch titles. With continuous input from full-time game developers, the tool is shaped
            by
            real production needs, not theoretical use cases.
        </p>

        <h2>The vision</h2>
        <p>
            zStudio aims to become the standard visual layout and scene-building tool for web game development — a fast,
            accessible, and scalable environment that integrates seamlessly into modern pipelines.
